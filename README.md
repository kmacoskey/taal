Terraform as a (golang) library. 

Terraform is a wonderful pattern and language for interacting with cloud API's. Unfortunately it is by design a standalone utility. The pattern of writing a program that interacts with the terraform standalone utility has been invented many times. This is yet another implentation, but hopefully more generic and re-usable as a golang libary.
